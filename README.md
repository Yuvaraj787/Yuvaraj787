# Hey there, I'm Yuvaraj Vetrivel 👋

I’m a Software Engineer at **Juspay**, where I work on building systems that are fast, reliable, and meaningful in the real world.  
Earlier, I interned at **athenahealth**, getting hands-on experience with large-scale healthcare software and understanding what production-grade engineering actually feels like.

I graduated with a **B.Tech in Information Technology from CEG, Anna University**  - the place that made me fall in love with problem-solving, DSA, and creating things that matter.

I enjoy writing clean, intentional code and thinking deeply about how systems behave. When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading non-fiction, swimming, or wandering through some system-design rabbit hole.  
Time flies when I'm learning or building something new.
